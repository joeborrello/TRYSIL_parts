# TRYSIL_parts
Replacement parts for the IKEA TRYSIL wardrobe. In STL formats for 3D printing and original CAD formats for modding.

`trysil-shelf-peg.STL` can be printed on FDM with layer height of 0.2mm and approximately 100% infill. I used PLA but other plastics should also work

`trysil-clothes-rod-peg.STL` experienced too much load for me to successfully print with FDM, so I sent out to have it done in SLS nylon
